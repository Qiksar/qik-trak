# qik-trak

Super fast and oppinionated setup for Hasura table and relationship tracking.

In one line, qik-trak applies intuitive names to your tables and relationships, and provides a no-touch setup process for automated tracking settings. In other words, you don't have to use the Hasura Console to track your database and modify relationships names, which can be very abstract when they are set to the defaults used by Hasura.

## The problem we're trying to solve

Personally, when I build and test systems I like to have a quick means of creating a database, loading data, setting up Hasura and running queries. Because data
get changed as tests are executed, I want to repeat this loop, so I can destroy the database (i.e. Docker container holding the DB), and create a completely
new database, where I know the starting state of all data.

You may think this is extreme, or unnecessary and it might actually only be suitable for rapid prototypes, and I'm open to all such oppinions.

But this is a real problem for me, and in other contexts, people solve this with in-memory databases and seed data. But I wanted to go a step further
and have a real database, with real GraphQL etc.

**Thought**: It may be the case that this 'solution' only really suits simple databases and particular stages of development, like rapid prototyping. 

## Oppinionated?

Yes, I don't like the names that Hasura gives to tables, pre-pending schema names, and I don't like the way relationships are named. That my oppinion.

This is the single reason I originally created Hasura Auto Tracker. But these days I found I need something really simple, driven by environment variables
not command line arguments, and something that I can run from the CLI if I am working on this project, or burn into a Docker container, and then just execute
through the docker command line.

The end result is that rather than having a GraphQL object called *customer_database_customers*, you will get just *customers*. More concise, and exactly as it's named in your schema.

## So what does it actually do?

if you're familiar with Hasura, you know the Admin Console enables you to connect to a database and track (connect graphql to database entities) through the Data tab.

Once a database is connected with Hasura, there will be a simple list of tables with Hasura's preferred names, and once these are "tracked" you will be offered a list
of foreign keys, again with Hasura's preferred naming for graph relationships.

So, its implicit here, that in order to track a database, tables and relationships, you have to run manual steps. That's not good for an automated build process, which setting up a local dev or test environment typically uses.

So putting it simple, qik-track sets up the Hasura tracking with concise and intuitive names, which applied to tables and relationships.

## Ok, how do we run it?

You can pull the code, edit the sample env file and input your own settings and save as .env then just run 

```
npm install
npm run

or:

node cli.js

or

docker-compose up -d 
This will build the tracker tool in a docker container, so you can quickly pull the container from your own registry and run it with no more setup, other than building and using an environment file.

```

## This is brilliant!!

Perhaps, but it can also be dangerous. Although the tool does use the Hasura API to setup the metadata, it remains to be seen whether it plays nicely with metadata other than tracking information. For example, when untracking, we will loose permissions. So there is more work to be done to understand use cases. Therefore, there are some todo items listed below.

# TODO

As this is a very new project, a simplification of previous work, and connected with the fact that I don't currently use the Hasura CLI, I'm conscious of some further work that needs to be done, most of which needs to be validated and oppinions, advice and comments are most welcome.

## Untracking tables will destroy permissions - what can be done about this?
The tracker should have a way to implement permissions, but this is duplicating the work of the Hasura CLI. But an alternative approach may be welcomed in the community.

Perhaps a YAML description of the database could help with creating and seeding the database (with autogenerated test data), then further aspects of the YAML could describe the required permissions.

## CRUD APIs
Based on acceptance of an oppinionated system, it may be valuable to generate REST endpoints that provide basic CRUD functions. This helps to reduce the amount of data handling code in the app, and refactors queries out of code, where they can be more easily edited through the Hasura console.
